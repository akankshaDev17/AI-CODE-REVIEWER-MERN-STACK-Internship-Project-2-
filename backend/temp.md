Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){return a+b;}
```

Issues:
*   **Undeclared Variables:** `a` and `b` are not declared as parameters or in the function's scope, leading to a `ReferenceError` if they are not defined in the global scope or an outer lexical environment. This is a common source of bugs.
*   **Lack of Explicit Inputs:** Functions should ideally operate on explicit inputs passed as parameters, rather than relying on global or implicitly available variables. This makes the function less reusable and harder to understand.
*   **Poor Readability & Maintainability:** It's unclear at a glance what `a` and `b` represent or where they are supposed to come from. This makes the code difficult to debug, test, and maintain.

Recommended Fix:

```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the sum of two numbers.
 * @param {number} num1 - The first number.
 * @param {number} num2 - The second number.
 * @returns {number} The sum of num1 and num2.
 */
function sum(num1, num2) {
    // Basic input validation could be added for production-grade code,
    // e.g., checking if num1 and num2 are actually numbers.
    if (typeof num1 !== 'number' || typeof num2 !== 'number') {
        console.warn("sum() received non-number arguments. Attempting to add anyway.");
        // Or throw new TypeError("Arguments must be numbers.");
    }
    return num1 + num2;
}

// Example usage:
// const result = sum(5, 10); // result will be 15
// console.log(result);
```

Improvements:
*   ✔ **Clear Parameters:** The function now explicitly accepts `num1` and `num2` as parameters, making its expected inputs clear and its behavior predictable.
*   ✔ **Eliminates `ReferenceError`:** Variables `num1` and `num2` are local to the function, resolving the issue of undeclared variables.
*   ✔ **Enhanced Reusability:** The function can now be easily reused with any two numbers, without relying on external state.
*   ✔ **Improved Readability & Maintainability:** It's immediately clear what the function does and what inputs it requires.
*   ✔ **Added JSDoc Documentation:** Provides clear documentation for the function's purpose, parameters, and return value, which is crucial for code understanding and collaboration.
*   ✔ **Considered Input Validation (Optional but Recommended):** Added a basic check for argument types, a common best practice for robust functions.

Final Note:
Always design functions to be self-contained and operate on explicit inputs. This promotes clarity, reusability, and reduces unexpected side effects, leading to more robust and maintainable code. Thorough documentation (like JSDoc) for function parameters and return types is also vital.
